GWiz is a framework for building gcode wizards.

To build a debian release, type "make all" at a shell prompt in this
directory. Since a release is built to install as the root user, it
uses sudo to get root privileges and will ask for your password.

This will create two .deb files gwiz...deb and demowiz...deb. The
demowiz file contains demo wizards, while the gwiz file contains gwiz,
itself.
