Description of the files in each directory
This file describes Version: 0.1

version:
   Contains a single line with two pipe ("|") delimited fields:
      The version of the format (as described in this file)
      The version of the wizard (assigned by the wizard creator)
   Version identifiers are strings, e.g.: 0.1.1
   At the present time, this file is NOT used.

desc:
  Contains a single line with two pipe ("|") delimited fields:
     The O_word to be used with the operation
     The title of the operation

screen: (actually screen.png, screen.jpg, screen.(other format))
  Contains a graphic image of the screen (400x300 pixels)
  !!! FOR NOW -- screen.png only

help:
  A help file for the operation. These lines may contain
  (limited) html. If the file is missing, a No Help Available message is
  displayed.

config:
  Contains the controls for the operation. Each control corresponds to an
  argument passed to the gcode. They are in order of argument number.
  Lines starting with # are comments and are ignored

  Fields are separated by '|':
     type: a single character must be in first column
     L - list selector
     S - signed decimal S000.0000
     U - unsigned decimal 000.0000

     name: the name of the parameter

     tooltip: a tool tip

     For type 'L' a list of strings. The first string is the
     default. The first is assigned the value zero, the second one,
     etc. 

     For type 'S' or U' a numeric default value is supplied.

validate (not yet implemented):
  A program or script in any language that returns 0 if the parameters
  are valid or non-zero if they are invalid. It is run as a pipe with
  the computed gcode as an input. If there is an error, standard
  output (which is piped to the wizard) contains the errors. (As an
  alternative, the args to the gcode are contained on the command
  line.)

*.ngc:
  A gcode subroutine implementing the wizard. All global o-words defined in the
  file should begin with the name of the subroutine. For example, if the 
  subroutine implements o<mill_circular_pocket>, helper functions should be
  named something like: o<mill_circular_pocket_initial>. The reason for this is
  to avoid name space clashes. The name of the .ngc is not important. If there
  are multiple .ngc files in the directory, all will be loaded in alphabetical
  order.
